# Pirate Midi CLiCK Web Editor

- Web MIDI only works in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera, and I have only tested it on desktop Chrome and Firefox.

- CLiCK must be plugged in before you go to [the web page](https://davidbdyer.github.io/piratemidi-click-web-editor/). If you not refresh page after you connect the CLiCK.
